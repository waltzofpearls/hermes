# hermes

Hermes is a personal hobby robot rover project. The rover platform is based on
a 4WD chassis controlled by an Arduino motor shield. Hermes has a Respberry Pi
as its brain. The Pi is responsible for communicating with a controller device
through WI-FI direct, processing and streaming video, sending commands to
Arduino, and many more.

Phase one aims to build a cell phone or tablet controlled robot rover without
any intelligence. The rover will be completely rely on the pilot's control.

In the following phases, I will add solar panel, obstacle avoidance, more sensors
and some machine learning to the rover, so it will have some limited intelligence.

More details and code to come as I'm building the robot.
